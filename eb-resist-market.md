<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EB Resist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive EB Resists</li><li>Negative EB Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EB resists, or electron beam resists, are materials used in lithography for semiconductor fabrication. The market is divided into positive and negative EB resists. Positive EB resists become soluble when exposed to electron beams, allowing selected areas to be removed during development, making them suitable for fine patterning applications. In contrast, negative EB resists harden upon exposure, leaving a defined pattern after development. Both types serve unique purposes, catering to diverse technological needs in microfabrication and advanced electronics.</p></p>
