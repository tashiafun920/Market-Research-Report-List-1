<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drainage Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical drainage tube market is primarily divided into two types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains rely on gravity to remove fluids from a surgical site, allowing natural drainage without external intervention. They are typically simple and low-maintenance. Active drains, on the other hand, use suction to actively draw out fluids, providing more control and efficiency in fluid management. Both types are essential in post-operative care, reducing the risk of complications and promoting healing by preventing fluid accumulation.</p></p>
