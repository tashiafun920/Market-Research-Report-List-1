<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Silicon PV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mono-Si Modules</li><li>Multi-Si Modules</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) market primarily consists of two types: mono-crystalline and multi-crystalline modules. Mono-Si modules, made from single-crystal silicon, offer higher efficiency and better performance in low light conditions, making them ideal for smaller spaces. In contrast, multi-Si modules, created from multiple silicon crystals, are generally less expensive but have lower efficiency and occupy more space. The choice between these two types often depends on budget, space availability, and the specific energy needs of a project.</p></p>
