<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micropipettor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filtered</li><li>Non-Filtered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micropipettor market is divided into two main types: filtered and non-filtered micropipettors. Filtered micropipettors are designed with a specialized filter that prevents contamination of samples and protects the pipetteâ€™s internal components, making them ideal for handling volatile or hazardous liquids. In contrast, non-filtered micropipettors lack this feature and are generally used for transferring non-toxic, non-volatile liquids. The choice between them depends on the specific application requirements, including sample integrity and ease of maintenance.</p></p>
